# Projecty Web
Projecty is a project management app based on spring.

## Motivation
My main assumption is to create a free and open-source focused on privacy project management application for everyone.
I know that project data are really sensitive so you feel better when you are the owner of them.
And for those who do not have a server, 
Projecty will be available on the hosted server completely for free (in the future).

## Note
The app has been divided into two separate projects. 
You can find front-end based on Vue at [projecty-web-front-end](https://github.com/marcinadd/projecty-web-front-end).

## Getting Started
### Via Docker
1. After changes run `./build_image.sh` in a project root directory to build application image.
1. Run`docker-compose up` in a project root directory.

Data is stored in a volume `db-data`. During first run of database container the scripts from `/sql-scripts` directory will be  are executed.

### Setup project manually
1. Clone repository
1. Import it to your favourite IDE
1. **Remember to edit application.properties**
    ```
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://db_host:db_port/db_name
    spring.datasource.username=db_user
    spring.datasource.password=db_password
    ```
    Make sure that this user have full access to database
1. Prepare DB for store oauth tokens; execute this SQL
    ```sql
   CREATE TABLE `oauth_access_token` (
     `token_id` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
     `token` mediumblob,
     `authentication_id` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
     `user_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
     `client_id` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
     `authentication` mediumblob,
     `refresh_token` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY (`authentication_id`)
   );
   CREATE TABLE `oauth_refresh_token` (
     `token_id` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
     `token` mediumblob,
     `authentication` mediumblob
   );
   ``` 
1. Build the app, run it and enjoy
1. Remember to check if the timezone is set correctly
